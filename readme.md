> :warning: **DANGER!** There be dragons here. This package can do serious damage if you misuse it. Or maybe even if you use it properly. 

Don't store any ssh private keys in your project - pull from outside your project directory. Don't check in any secrets or any server info to any of your repositories. Use environment variables or a secret vault or some other mechanism that doesn't require you to expose sensitive information.

You've been warned.
